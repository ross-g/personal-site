Just a short post to share quite a cool timelapse video of the [Fortune Island](https://forzamotorsport.net/en-us/news/fh4_fortuneisland) expansion for Forza Horizon 4. It's a pretty great showcase for the aurora borealis effects that [Adan Currey](https://www.artstation.com/cui2i2ey) and I worked on for the past month!

This was a really interesting shader to collaborate on with the Lighting team.
