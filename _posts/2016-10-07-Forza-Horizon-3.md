Well we've been working hard on our latest racing title [**Forza Horizon 3**](http://www.forzamotorsport.net/en-US/games/fh3) for well over a year now. This time located in the stunning open world playground of Australia, we've definitely tried to set the bar way higher for this entry of the series.

The game was released on September 27th, and while the previous two games have both been really well reviewed the reception for FH3 has just blown everyone away in the studio. We're currently sat at a pretty stable 91 on [Metacritic](http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/forza-horizon-3) which impressively makes us the #3 best reviewed Xbox-One game of 2016...

... and the joint 5th highest scoring Xbox-One game of all time. Which is amazing!

But I won't write any more about it for now, as screenshots tell a much better story.
