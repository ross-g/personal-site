I am currently a Senior Technical Artist working on top tier console games as part of the team at [Playground Games](http://www.playground-games.com). Over our last few projects I've become responsible for the character & animation pipelines alongside our lead technical animator as well as being widely involved with large parts of the environment pipeline and toolset.

### Background

I originally studied game art at [Escape Studios](http://www.escapestudios.com/), having been interested in digital art previously. After my crash course in (most things) 3D I started working as an Environment Artist at Playground Games in 2011. Wanting to push more into developing my technical skills I progressed into a TA role towards the close of my first project in 2012. Going through a full production cycle as a working artist has given me a lot of context for the job I now do.
